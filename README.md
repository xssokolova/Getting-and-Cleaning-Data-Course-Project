# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project


*"Run_analysis.R" script is based on Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset (provided by coursera)
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.*


# "Run_analysis.R" script

Run_analysis.R is written on R programming language. It merges the training and the test sets and clean the data, the result of it is the file called "TidyDataSet.txt"


# "TidyDataSet.txt" data

"TidyDataSet.txt" contains 180 obs. of  81 variables, the average of each variable (measurements on the mean and standard deviation) for each activity and each subject.


# The following files were used for the Run_analysis.R script (provided by coursera)
- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.
- 'features.txt': List of all features.
- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.
- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.
- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.
- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.
- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.
- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 
- 'test/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.
